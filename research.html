              <h5>Monetary Policy, Economic Uncertainty, and R&D Expenditure</h5>
            </a>
            <div class="articles"> This paper studies the effect of monetary policy shocks on the research and development investment in the US economy.
                Using aggregate quarterly data and high-frequency monetary policy shocks, I show that a 20 basis point
                increase in the interest rate decreases the growth rate of aggregate R&D expenditure by 0.18 percentage
                points, and this effect is persistent up to five years. Furthermore, using firm-level data from Compustat
                for the period 1990-2019, I show a similar result in the US firms' reaction to monetary policy shocks. 
                Firms with higher liquidity and lower leverage ratio decrease their R&D investment more after a contractionary
                monetary policy shock. A more careful disentangling of the monetary policy shock shows that this effect on 
                aggregate economy is mainly driven by federal fund rate shocks and forward guidance shocks.

            </a>
            <div class="articles">  The sanctions imposed on Iran at the beginning of 2012 have simultaneously limited
the country’s access to the international financial system, levied a strict boycott on Iran’s
oil and petrochemical exports, and limited imports of intermediate goods. This paper
tries to quantify the aggregate and heterogeneous effects of these sanctions. Applying
the synthetic control method, I show that the sanctions had persistent and significant
effects on the Iranian economy. The cost reached its maximum of 19.1 percent of real
GDP four years after the application of the sanctions, and the economy has not fully recovered
after their removal. I trace the poverty dynamics for different household groups
after the sanctions by adopting a synthetic panel using Iran’s household income and expenditure
survey data. Inconsistently with the sanctions’ initial goals, poverty dynamics
suggest that households working in governmental sectors and educated households are
unaffected by the sanctions. Instead, the sanctions condemn young, illiterate, rural, or
religious minority households to poverty.

              <h5> The Sentimental Propagation of Lottery Winnings: Evidence from the Spanish Christmas Lottery (with Evi Pappa and Isabel Mico-Millan)
              </h5>
            </a>
            <div class="articles">
              We leverage a unique natural experiment, the Spanish Christmas lottery, to investigate
the impact of highly geographically clustered winnings on macroeconomic aggregates, and on
sentiment and durable consumption, using survey evidence. Lottery winnings induce significant demand effects, 
especially during recessions, reducing unemployment and increasing job creation and CPI prices. 
Albeit not receiving wins, households in winning provinces become
more optimistic on impact and significantly increase their durable consumption (for furniture
and vehicles) six months after the shock. We propose this lottery as an unconventional fiscal
policy tool for increasing aggregate revenues and stimulating local demand without crowding
out aggregate activity.
