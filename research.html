            </a>
            <div class="articles"> This paper studies the effect of monetary policy shocks on the research and develop-
ment expenditure in the US economy under different economic uncertainty states. Using
aggregate quarterly data and monetary policy shocks derived from a high-frequency identification scheme,
  I show that a 20 basis point increase in the interest rate decreases the
aggregate R&D expenditure by 0.6 percent, and this effect is persistent for up to four
years. Furthermore, using firm-level data from Compustat for the period 1990-2019, I
show a similar persistent decline in the US firms’ R&D expenditure in response to con-
tractionary monetary policy shocks. The effect on R&D expenditure is stronger when
firms face higher uncertainty. Economic uncertainty decreases firms’ leverage ratio and makes
them more financially constraint. As a result, firms become more responsive on their
R&D investment after a contractionary monetary policy during high uncertainty periods.
I use a medium-scale DSGE model with endogenous output growth and financial
frictions to interpret the empirical results and to highlight the importance of the credit
channel for altering the effects of monetary policy on firms’ investment in RD in the
presence of economic uncertainty.

            </a>
            <div class="articles">  The sanctions imposed on Iran at the beginning of 2012 have simultaneously limited
the country’s access to the international financial system, levied a strict boycott on Iran’s
oil and petrochemical exports, and limited imports of intermediate goods. This paper
tries to quantify the aggregate and heterogeneous effects of these sanctions. Applying
the synthetic control method, I show that the sanctions had persistent and significant
effects on the Iranian economy. The cost reached its maximum of 19.1 percent of real
GDP four years after the application of the sanctions, and the economy has not fully recovered
after their removal. I trace the poverty dynamics for different household groups
after the sanctions by adopting a synthetic panel using Iran’s household income and expenditure
survey data. Inconsistently with the sanctions’ initial goals, poverty dynamics
suggest that households working in governmental sectors and educated households are
unaffected by the sanctions. Instead, the sanctions condemn young, illiterate, rural, or
religious minority households to poverty.

              <h5> The Sentimental Propagation of Lottery Winnings: Evidence from the Spanish Christmas Lottery (with Evi Pappa and Isabel Mico-Millan)
              </h5>
            </a>
            <div class="articles">
              We leverage a unique natural experiment, the Spanish Christmas lottery, to investigate
the impact of highly geographically clustered winnings on macroeconomic aggregates, and on
sentiment and durable consumption, using survey evidence. Lottery winnings induce significant demand effects, 
especially during recessions, reducing unemployment and increasing job creation and CPI prices. 
Albeit not receiving wins, households in winning provinces become
more optimistic on impact and significantly increase their durable consumption (for furniture
and vehicles) six months after the shock. We propose this lottery as an unconventional fiscal
policy tool for increasing aggregate revenues and stimulating local demand without crowding
out aggregate activity.

            </a>
            <div class="articles">  This study constructs a new instrument for the public investment news shock based on the European Investment
Bank public loans. Using more than 6300 loans financing projects in 18 countries during
2000-2019, I show that the loans allocated to public firms are a good proxy for the public
investment news shocks. This shock increases output, consumption, and employment in the econ-
omy without crowding out private investment. The cumulative public investment multiplier
is higher for countries with: lower per capita GDP, lower debt, lower uncertainty, higher
local autonomy, and higher government size. I am currently studying the effect of this shock
on the EU firms using large scale firm-level data.
