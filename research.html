            <div class="articles">
         We exploit the Spanish Christmas lottery and consumer confidence survey data to investigate the impact of highly geographically clustered lottery winnings on consumer
sentiment and durable consumption. Albeit not receiving lottery prizes, consumers in winning provinces become significantly more optimistic about the Spanish macroeconomic 
      conditions than those living elsewhere. This variation in sentiment is shown to be orthogonal to changes in regional fundamentals and leads to a rise in spending intentions. 
    Young, less educated, low-income, and unemployed individuals react stronger to the lottery shock. At the regional level, lottery wins significantly increase car licenses,
reduce unemployment, and intensify job creation and prices.

              <h6> <strong>Economics & Politics</strong>, Lead Article, Nov 2022 </h6> 
              
          <div class="articles">  The sanctions imposed on Iran at the beginning of 2012 have simultaneously limited
the country’s access to the international financial system, levied a strict boycott on Iran’s
oil and petrochemical exports, and limited imports of intermediate goods. This paper
tries to quantify the aggregate and heterogeneous effects of these sanctions. Applying
the synthetic control method, I show that the sanctions had persistent and significant
effects on the Iranian economy. The cost reached its maximum of 19.1 percent of real
GDP four years after the application of the sanctions, and the economy has not fully recovered
after their removal. I trace the poverty dynamics for different household groups
after the sanctions by adopting a synthetic panel using Iran’s household income and expenditure
survey data. Inconsistently with the sanctions’ initial goals, poverty dynamics
suggest that households working in governmental sectors and educated households are
unaffected by the sanctions. Instead, the sanctions condemn young, illiterate, rural, or
religious minority households to poverty.

              <h5>Monetary Policy, Economic Uncertainty, and Firms R&D Expenditure</h5>
            </a>
            <div class="articles">  This paper studies the state-dependent effect of monetary policy shocks on firms
research and development (R&D) expenditure in the US economy. Empirical results
suggest that a 20 basis point increase in the interest rate decreases the aggregate R&D
expenditure by 0.6 percent. Furthermore, using Compustat firm-level data, I show a
persistent decline in US firms’ R&D expenditure in response to contractionary monetary
policy shocks. The effect on R&D expenditure is stronger for interest rate hikes and
when firms face higher uncertainty. Economic uncertainty decreases firms’ leverage ratio
and makes them more financially constrained. As a result, firms become more responsive
in their R&D investment following a contractionary monetary policy shock. I use
a medium-scale DSGE model with endogenous output growth and financial frictions to
interpret the empirical results. The theoretical model highlights the importance of the
credit channel for altering the effects of monetary policy on firms’ investment in R&D in
the presence of economic uncertainty.

               <h6> with Evi Pappa </h6>
            </a>
            <div class="articles">  We analyze the economic impact of public investment using European Investment
Bank (EIB) loans for infrastructure to publicly owned firms and governments as an 
instrument for public investment shocks. To address endogeneity in loan approval, we
apply the Inverse-Probability-Weighted Regression-Adjustment (IPWRA) estimator and
a local projection IV approach. Our findings show that public investment boosts
employment, output, and private investment in the medium term without causing inflation and
significant effects on consumption and debt-to-GDP. The cumulative output multiplier
reaches a maximum of 3.5 five years after the shock and is higher in countries with higher
public debt-to-GDP ratios or under favorable financial conditions. Interestingly, the strong crowd-in effect on private investment
amplifies the overall impact. </p>

               <h5> Fiscal Multipliers and the Maturity Financing of Government Spending Shocks </h5>
               <h6> with Jochen Mankart, Rigas Oikonomou, and Romanos Priftis </h6>
            </a>
            <div class="articles">  This paper shows that debt-financed fiscal multipliers vary depending on the maturity of
debt issued to finance spending. Utilizing state-dependent SVAR models and local projections
for post-war US data, we show that a fiscal expansion financed with short-term debt increases
output more than one financed with long-term debt. The reason for this result is that only
the former leads to a significant increase in private consumption. To rationalize this finding,
we construct an incomplete markets model in which households invest in long- and short-term
assets. Short assets provide liquidity services; households can use them to cover sudden spending
needs. An increase in the supply of these assets, through a short-term debt financed government
expenditure shock, makes it easier for constrained households to meet their spending needs and
crowds in private consumption. We first show this mechanism analytically in a simplified model,
and then quantify it in a carefully calibrated New Keynesian model. We find that differences
in fiscal multipliers across short-term and long-term financed shocks can be large. We explore
how these differences are influenced by the monetary and fiscal policy rules..</p>
