            <h5>From bricklayers to waiters: labor market adjustment of Spanish workers during The Great Recession</h5>
            <p align="justify"> This paper analyzes the impact on worker’s employment and earnings trajectories
caused by the employment contraction of the Spanish construction sector
during the Great Recession. Moreover, it quantifies the relevance of the interaction
between worker skills and local sectoral composition on the worker’s labour market
adjustment during the same period. The identification strategy exploits variation
in the construction sector’s employment contraction across Spanish provinces and
a rich set of worker characteristics available in administrative panel data (CSWL2).
I show that individuals initially employed in the construction sector experienced a
large impact on their cumulative wages during Spain’s economic downturn. This
impact resulted from longer unemployment and non-employment spells rather than
a decrease in the average wages of exposed workers. Supported on the previous
results, I study to what extent the local sectoral composition contributes to alleviating
the shock’s impact on worker’s outcomes. The results suggest that earnings
losses are larger for workers in provinces where the sectoral composition provides
fewer opportunities to change sectors. Furthermore, the reallocation probabilities
depend on the interaction of worker and regional characteristics. One implication
of these findings is that high sectoral concentrations in a region may harm worker’s
outcomes in case of a sectoral shock. Finally, these findings support that short
term labour market adjustments are mainly intersectoral rather than inter-regional,
consistent with recent empirical evidence in other settings.</p>

            <h5>Trends in inequality: A national and disaggregated earnings inequality study for Spain, 1980-2016</h5>
            <p align="justify"> This article studies the evolution of Spain’s wage inequality between 1995 and
2017, emphasizing differences in trends at cohorts, sectors, and regional levels
and using data of Spain’s Continues Sample of Working Histories (Muestra
Continua de Vidas Laborales MCVL). This dataset allows studying how broad
changes in inequality are decomposed at a disaggregated level. The results suggest
that wage inequality in Spain is strongly countercyclical. After the Great
Recession, the earnings distribution became even more unequal, this is appreciated
over all the autonomous communities, especially Andalusia, where the
construction sector was relatively more important, in opposition the North of
Spain has a higher percentage of the highly educated workers, and less dependent
on the construction sector before the crisis. Possible explanations for the documented
evolution in earnings inequality are the evolution of the unemployment
rate and the development of the college wage premium.</p>
