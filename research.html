              <h5>Who is Afraid of Sanctions? The Macroeconomic and Distributional Effects of the Sanctions Against Iran
              </h5>
            </a>
            <div class="articles">
              The sanctions imposed on Iran at the beginning of 2012 have simultaneously limited
the country’s access to the international financial system, levied a strict boycott on Iran’s
oil and petrochemical exports, and limited imports of intermediate goods. This paper
tries to quantify the aggregate and heterogeneous effects of these sanctions. Applying
the synthetic control method, I show that the sanctions had persistent and significant
effects on the Iranian economy. The cost reached its maximum of 19.1 percent of real
GDP four years after the application of the sanctions, and the economy has not fully recovered
after their removal. I trace the poverty dynamics for different household groups
after the sanctions by adopting a synthetic panel using Iran’s household income and expenditure
survey data. Inconsistently with the sanctions’ initial goals, poverty dynamics
suggest that households working in governmental sectors and educated households are
unaffected by the sanctions. Instead, the sanctions condemn young, illiterate, rural, or
religious minority households to poverty

              <h5>The Sentimental Propagation of Lottery Winnings: Evidence from the Spanish Christmas Lottery (with Evi Pappa and Isabel Mico-Milan)</h5>
            </a>
            <div class="articles"> We use the Spanish Christmas lottery as a ”natural” experiment to analyze the 
              individual and aggregate responses to a transitory income shock which is shared among
many people living in the same province. Lottery winnings spur economic sentiment and
induce significant demand effects that lead to a reduction in unemployment, a large rise
in job vacancies and moderate increases in CPI prices at the province level. Drawing on
individual survey data, we show that households living in winning provinces, although
they do not directly receive wins, become more optimistic about the current and future
economic conditions on impact and increase their durable consumption expenditure 
significantly six months after the lottery draw, especially in furniture and vehicles. Lottery
shocks impact mostly the consumption and sentiment of younger individuals and have
stronger effects during recessions. We propose the Spanish Christmas lottery as an 
unconventional fiscal policy tool for increasing aggregate tax revenues and stimulating local
economic conditions without crowding out aggregate activity

              <h5>Monetary Policy and Firms R&D Investment Decision</h5>
            </a>
            <div class="articles"> This paper focuses on the effect of monetary policy on the research and development investment
                in the US economy. Using aggregate quarterly data and high-frequency monetary policy shocks, I show that a 25 basis
                point increase in the interest rate decreases the growth rate of aggregate $R\&D$ expenditure by 0.2 percentage points,
                and this effect persists for about five years. This effect holds mainly in the high-unemployment and/or lower financial
                uncertainty period. Furthermore, using firm-level data from Cumpostat for the time period 1990-2019, I show a similar
                result in the US firms' reaction to monetary policy shocks, and firms with higher liquidity, lower leverage ratio, and bigger
                firms increase their $R\&D$ investment more. A more careful disentangling of the monetary policy shock shows that this effect
                is mainly driven by federal fund rate shocks and forward guidance shocks
